## Projects as assignments in University.

### EX1 - Basics of CV2.
* read/load equlization histograms gamma scaling.

### EX2 - Edge detections and cicrcle detections.
* Image derivatives & blurring
* Edge detection - Canny, Soble, and log laplacian.
* Hough Circles - detecting circles.

### EX3 - Scaling and downscaling images, Image marging.
* Lucas Kanade optical flow
* Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids
* Merge two images, using masks and guasian and laplacian pyramids for smooth edges.
